Project Overview
We'll create a simple linear regression model using NumPy to understand how it works from scratch. This project will cover the following steps:

Generate Synthetic Data
Implement Linear Regression using NumPy
Visualize the Results
# Linear Regression with Synthetic Data

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of linear regression using synthetic data generated with NumPy. The model is trained using the Normal Equation method, and the performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE). The project also includes data visualization using Matplotlib.

## Features

- **Data Generation:** Synthetic data generation for a simple linear relationship between `X` and `y`.
- **Linear Regression:** Calculation of optimal parameters (theta) using the Normal Equation.
- **Prediction:** Making predictions on new data points.
- **Visualization:** Plotting the original data and the regression line.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluation of the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/): `pip install numpy`
- [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/): `pip install matplotlib`

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-synthetic-data.git
   cd linear-regression-synthetic-data
